/**
 * Helper class to permit the synchronous call of a method hosted in a secondary
 * thread, useful for library that make mandatory the use of a specific thread
 * class in order to call their functions.</P>
 * This monitor class is the link between the calling and the called thread.

 * <B>Monitor used :</B><BR>
 * The monitor class has the same methods than the callee object but use the
 * intermediate BaseMethod object and in fact run the <CODE>call()</CODE> method
 * of the monitor. The thread synchronization is ensured by the monitor's methods.
 * <PRE>
 *   class TCalledThread extends BaseThreadMonitor {
 *       public int myMethod(TCallee callee, int param) {
 *           TMyMethod method = new TMyMethod(callee,param);
 *           call( method );
 *           return method.result;
 *       }
 *    }
 * </PRE>
 * <B>Calling thread use :</B><BR>
 * The call a method must be done within a inherited BaseMethod class, in its
 * <CODE>execute()</CODE> method. The BaseMethod object is constructed with all
 * the method parameters, whose need to be stored in order to be used when the
 * method is called.<BR>
 * <PRE>
 *   class TMyMethod implements BaseThreadMonitor.BaseMethod {
 *        TMyMethod(TCallee callee, int param) {
 *            this.callee = callee;
 *            this.param = param;
 *        }
 *        public void execute() {
 *            result = callee.myMethod(param);
 *        }
 *        TCallee callee;
 *        int result;
 *        int param;
 *    }
 * </PRE>
 * Call from the calling thread :
 * <PRE>
 *   int myResult = myMonitor.myMethod(myParam);
 * </PRE>
 * <B>Called thread use :</B><BR>
 * The called thread must wait for an incomming event and when this event occurs
 * it gets the current BaseMethod object and call its <CODE>execute()</CODE> method.
 * This is done by calling the <CODE>run()</CODE> method of the ThreadMonitor.
 * The result in then stored in an internal temporary field which can be read by
 * the calling thread.
 * <PRE>
 *   class TCalledThread extends Thread {
 *        public TCalledThread(TMyMonitor monitor) {
 *            this.monitor = monitor;
 *        }
 *        public void run() {
 *            // Run some initializations
 *            ....
 *            // Run an infinite loop
 *            while(true) {
 *                monitor.run();
