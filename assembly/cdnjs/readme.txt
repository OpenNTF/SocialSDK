CDNJS provides a content delivery network version of the compiled and minified SBT js files. 

CDNJS reads these files and generates a version for any tag it finds on the file history
The cdnjs files are referenced here. https://cdnjs.com/libraries/sbt

The files in this directory are to be manualy updated after each release build but before the source tree is tagged.
