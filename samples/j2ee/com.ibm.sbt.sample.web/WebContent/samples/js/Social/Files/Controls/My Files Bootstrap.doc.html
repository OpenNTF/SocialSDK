This sample shows how to display a list of files using bootstrap css. 
The FileRendererMixin is required this will apply bootstrap styles to the sorting and paging.
There is a default bootstrap template that will be applied, that is similar to the connections layout.
This sample uses a custom template for displaying the list of files. 
To use a custom template, inside the html file put the template html inside a script type="text/template" tag and give it an id.
Then in the js file find the element by id, this sample uses dom.byId and get the text or textContent of the element.
Then set the grid render to use that text content.
