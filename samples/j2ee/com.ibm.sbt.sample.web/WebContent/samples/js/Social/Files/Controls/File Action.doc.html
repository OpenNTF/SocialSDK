This sample displays a grid of the user's files. The ample also demonstrates how to override the grid's
tooltip() and execute() function. The tooltip() function is responsible for returning the text to display in a tooltip
when the user mouse overs an item. The execute() function handles the onClick event of an element.

The sample uses the "myFiles" type parameter, to display files that belong to the authenticated user.
