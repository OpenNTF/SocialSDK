Demonstrates the usage of the Change Entry Type method. This method can be used to change the Type of an Activity Node.

The following types of entries can be changed to other types:
chat
email
entry
reply
todo

Things to keep in mind when converting entry types:
- When you convert an entry into a reply entry, you cannot associate the reply with an activity or a section directly. It must be associated with an existing activity entry.
- When you convert an entry into a to-do entry, if you do not provide values for the <snx:assignedto> and <snx:duedate> elements, the Assigned To and Due Date fields will be empty.
