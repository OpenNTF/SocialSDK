infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this 
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation 
is filed.

or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet 
the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative

     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as 
     part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices 
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an 
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such 
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying 
     the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 
exercise of permissions under this License.

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless 
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You 
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but 
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility 
of such damages.

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other 
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. 
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own 
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other

======================================================================
The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out 
in the DOU for Dojo):

The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build 
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool.  Shrinksafe 
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License 
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has been made available at 
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.  

The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to 
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino 
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe 
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.
